Description:
    Writing this attribute sets the oversampling average mode.
    Reading it, shows the configured mode.
    Available modes can be displayed using the oversampling_mode_available
    attribute.
    When writing this attribute to change the oversampling mode, this will
    have the following side effects:

      - soft reset the ADC to flush the oversampling block and FIFO

      - the available oversampling ratios depend on the oversampling mode
        configured so to avoid misconfiguration, changing the mode will disable
        the oversampling by setting the ratio to 1.

      - the list of available ratios (displayed by reading the
        oversampling_ratio_available attribute) will be updated when changing
        the oversampling mode.

Description:
    Display the available oversampling average modes. The two available modes
    are "normal" and "rolling" where "normal" average mode is the default one.

      - normal averaging involves taking a number of samples, adding them
        together, and dividing the result by the number of samples taken.
        This result is then output from the device. The sample data is cleared
        when the process completes. Because we need more samples to output a
        value, the data output rate decrease with the oversampling ratio.

      - rolling oversampling mode uses a first in, first out (FIFO) buffer of
        the most recent samples in the averaging calculation, allowing the ADC
        throughput rate and output data rate to stay the same, since we only need
        to take only one sample for each new conversion.
